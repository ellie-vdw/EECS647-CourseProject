Unfortunately 000webhost.com has a single user managing the website and database. However, we can make live changes to this github repository and manually update the 000webhost page and this should reflect our changes. 

Our website and the changes as of Saturday, April 23, can be found here: https://eecs647-course-project.000webhostapp.com/
